Retrofit 2.0
http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/retrofit-2.0/en
I have to change my error handling strategy, but I think it's good for clarity.
I used to parse the throwable error by checking if it's an instance of RetrofitError, and by calling getBodyAs(MyErrorObject.class).
Now, failure comes in onResponse, and I just have to call isSuccess(), and if it's false, I parse the errorBody like:
ErrorMessage errorMessage = new Gson().fromJson(response.errorBody().string(), ErrorMessage.class);
do you think there is a better way, knowing I'd like to print a toast with the errorMessage.message for each call ?
