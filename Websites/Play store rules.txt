 You should have called it Runewords for Diablo 2® and then in the description included "Diablo 2 is a registered trademark of Blizzard Entertainment... blah blah blah"
 Use a distinct name—Don't give your app a name that is confusingly similar to another company's trademark.
Use a distinct app icon and logo—Don't use a modified version of another company’s trademarked logo.
A disclaimer stating that your app is not affiliated with the trademark owner or that your app is not the "official" app may not be sufficient to avoid infringement.
